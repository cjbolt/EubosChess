# EubosChess
A Java based, UCI compliant, chess engine. Uses jcpi from com.fluxchess.
Currently implements a (very slow) depth first minimax move search. Plays legal chess, not withstanding the 50 move and three-fold repetition rules. Now good enough to have some fun against, though has no opening book or end game tables. This is my first chess engine, my first full Java project, my first open source contribution...
